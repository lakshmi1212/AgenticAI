# Selenium Automation Suite: AgenticAI

## Project Overview
Automated generation and deployment of Selenium Python scripts from validated test cases. The suite enables seamless transformation of structured test cases into maintainable automation scripts, securely integrated with Git workflows for enterprise adoption.

## Key Features
- Batch processing of validated test cases into modular Selenium scripts
- Secure integration with GitHub for commit/push operations
- Comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, troubleshooting, and maintenance

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Google Chrome (or supported browser)
- ChromeDriver (matching browser version)
- Git

### Python Environment Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Selenium Installation
```bash
pip install selenium
```

### Git Configuration
- Ensure you have a valid GitHub Personal Access Token
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lakshmi1212/AgenticAI.git
cd AgenticAI
```

## Usage Guidelines
- Place validated test case files in `/testcases/` (if batch processing)
- Generated scripts are located in `/tests/`
- To run a test:
```bash
python tests/test_login.py
```
- For batch execution, use a test runner (e.g., pytest)

## Maintenance Procedures
- To update or extend scripts, modify files in `/tests/`
- For new test cases, add to `/testcases/` and rerun the agent
- Ensure all dependencies are up to date (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- **Invalid test cases**: Ensure all required fields (steps, expected results) are present
- **Git errors**: Verify token and branch permissions; check network connectivity
- **Environment setup**: Confirm Python, Selenium, and ChromeDriver versions are compatible

### Diagnostic Procedures
- Review logs in `/logs/` (if available)
- Run scripts with verbose output for error tracing

## Support & Escalation
- For documentation or automation issues, contact the repository owner via GitHub Issues
- Escalate critical failures by tagging maintainers in issues

## Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repo and submit pull requests for enhancements
- Adhere to Python best practices and PEP8
- Provide clear commit messages and documentation for all changes

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional frameworks (e.g., Playwright, Cypress)
- Parallel/batch script generation
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Scheduled maintenance and review cycles

# Selenium Automation Suite

## Project Overview
Automated generation and deployment of Selenium Python scripts from validated test cases. This project transforms structured test cases into maintainable Selenium scripts, integrates securely with Git, and provides professional documentation for seamless team adoption.

## Key Features
- Automated script generation from validated test cases
- Modular, maintainable Python Selenium scripts
- Secure Git integration for commit/push operations
- Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guide

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip
- Google Chrome (or preferred browser)
- ChromeDriver (ensure version matches your browser)
- Git

### Python Environment Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lakshmi1212/AgenticAI.git
   cd AgenticAI
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If requirements.txt is missing, install manually:)
   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

### Git Configuration
- Ensure you have a valid GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Configure Git with your username/email

## Usage Guidelines
- Test scripts are located in `/tests/`.
- To run a test:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_login.py
   ```
- Scripts are modular; each script corresponds to a test case.
- Update test data as required in script variables.

## Maintenance Procedures
- To add new test cases, follow the validated structure and use the agent to generate new scripts.
- For updates, modify the scripts and commit changes using standard Git workflows.
- For framework extension, consider implementing the Page Object Model for scalability.

## Troubleshooting Guide
### Common Issues
- **Invalid test cases:** Ensure test cases follow the validated structure.
- **Git errors:** Check token validity, repo access, and branch name.
- **Selenium errors:** Verify browser/driver compatibility.

### Diagnostic Procedures
- Check logs for script generation and commit status.
- Dry-run scripts for syntax validation before commit.

### Support Resources
- Contact: [project maintainer email or GitHub Issues]
- Documentation: See this README and inline script comments.

### Escalation Procedures
- For persistent issues, escalate to the automation engineering team or open a GitHub issue.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repo and submit pull requests with clear descriptions.
- Follow PEP8 and project-specific coding standards.

## Future Considerations
- Support for additional frameworks/languages (e.g., Playwright, Java)
- Batch/parallel processing of test cases
- CI/CD integration for automated validation and deployment
- Scheduled reviews for maintainability

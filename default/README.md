# Selenium Automation Suite

## Project Overview
This repository automates the process of converting validated test cases into maintainable Selenium Python scripts. It enables automated retrieval, generation, and deployment of test scripts to streamline quality assurance and continuous integration workflows.

## Key Achievements
- Automated generation of Selenium Python scripts from validated test cases
- Secure commit and push operations to GitHub
- Comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, troubleshooting, and maintenance

## Success Metrics
- Number of scripts generated per run
- Commit success rate
- Documentation completeness

## Requirements Assessment
- **Inputs**: Validated test cases, Git access token, repository URL, target branch
- **Outputs**: Production-ready Selenium Python scripts, documentation

## Technical Approach
- Modular code structure (one script per test case)
- Page Object Model (where applicable)
- Secure GitHub integration
- Robust error handling and logging

## Implementation Details
1. **Retrieve validated test cases**
2. **Generate maintainable Selenium Python scripts**
3. **Save scripts in `/tests/` directory**
4. **Commit and push scripts and documentation to the repository**
5. **Log all operations and errors**

## Quality Assurance
- Syntax and logical validation (dry-run/linting)
- Commit verification
- Security checks (no token leakage)
- Documentation of validation results

## Deliverables
- `/tests/` directory containing Selenium Python scripts
- `README.md` with comprehensive documentation
- Commit logs and status reports

## Setup Instructions
1. **Python Environment**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    pip install pytest
    ```
3. **WebDriver Setup**: Download and configure appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver)
4. **Git Configuration**: Set up Git with access token permissions for repository

## Configuration Steps
- Provide GitHub access token, repository URL, and target branch when running the agent

## Usage Guidelines
- Run the agent to automatically generate and commit scripts
- Scripts are located in `/tests/` directory
- Use `pytest` to execute test scripts:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```

## Maintenance Procedures
- To update scripts, rerun the agent with updated test cases
- Extend functionality by adding new test cases or customizing scripts

## Quality Assurance Report
- Scripts validated for syntax and logical correctness
- Commit status verified for each push
- Token security enforced (not exposed in logs or files)
- Adherence to Python and Selenium best practices

## Troubleshooting and Support
### Common Issues
- Invalid test case structure
- Git commit/push errors
- WebDriver setup failures
- Dependency installation problems

### Diagnostic Procedures
- Review logs generated by the agent
- Check GitHub Actions or CI/CD logs for push errors
- Validate Python and Selenium installations

### Support Resources
- Documentation in this README
- Repository issue tracker
- Contact: [Maintainer email or GitHub handle]

### Escalation Procedures
- If issues cannot be resolved, escalate to the automation engineering team or repository maintainer

## Future Considerations
- Support for additional frameworks (e.g., Playwright, Cypress)
- Batch and parallel script generation
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines and cloud storage
- Scheduled maintenance and update cycles

## Sample Structure
- `/tests/test_login.py` (example script)
- `/README.md` (project documentation)
- Commit log: `Add Selenium scripts for validated test cases [timestamp]`
